---+ TODO List

---++ Code-analysis

---+++ Control structures

---++++ Disjunction (;)

We have some state at the start and multiple paths to continue that must
be rejoined at the end. Actually, in practice they are not rejoined, but
if we cannot rejoin them the  possible   flow-control  paths  we need to
analyse will explode.


---++++ If-then-else (->;)

---++++ Not (\+)

Is the same as (Cond->fail;true)

---++++ Special predicates

  * format(Stream, Format, Arguments)


---+++ Multiple clauses

---+++ Recursion

---+++ Meta-predicates: the pred(Type1, ...) type

---+++ Dealing with sub-goals that have no signature

Two options:

  1. Work from the leaves upwards
  2. Unfold code as you encounter it

---++ Signatures

?- listing(current_signature). (layout)
